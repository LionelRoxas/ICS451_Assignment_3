Welcome to the Simple HTTP File Transfer Program!

This is a sample text file that will be transferred from the server to the client.
The file needs to be between 5KB and 10KB in size to meet the assignment requirements.

Here's some content to help reach the minimum size requirement:

[Technical Information]
The HTTP protocol is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
When you type a URL in your browser, it sends an HTTP request to a web server.
The server then responds with the requested content, along with HTTP headers that
provide metadata about the response.

[How This Program Works]
1. The server listens on a specified port for incoming connections
2. When a client connects, the server reads this file
3. The server sends HTTP headers followed by the file contents
4. The client receives the data and saves it to client_file.txt

[Sample Data Section]
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor 
incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis 
nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
